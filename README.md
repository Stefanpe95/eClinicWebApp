A web application has been created that allows the user (doctor or patient) to schedule an appointment.
When using a web application, the user (doctor or patient) first logs in to the software system, by entering his own username and password. The software system then allows the user to view their own data, a list of their own examinations, as well as a list of doctors or patients who belong to the system.
The software system should enable the user (doctor) to view, add, and delete user data, as well as data on their own scheduled examinations.
The software system should allow the user (patient) to view user data, as well as data on their own scheduled examinations.
After the user has scheduled the review, the software system will confirm the successfully scheduled review and display the list of their own scheduled reviews again.
